Computing background
 -> ncdm species i=1 sampled with 11 (resp. 5) points for purpose of background (resp. perturbation) integration. In the relativistic limit it gives Delta N_eff = 1.0132
 -> total N_eff = 3.046 (sumed over ultra-relativistic and ncdm species)
 -> non-cold dark matter species with i=1 has m_i = 6.000000e-02 eV (so m_i / omega_i =9.318986e+01 eV)
 -> age = 13.841728 Gyr
 -> conformal age = 14185.432367 Mpc
Computing thermodynamics with Y_He=0.2478
 -> recombination at z = 1089.216827

    with comoving sound horizon = 144.716705 Mpc
    angular diameter distance = 12.753942 Mpc
    and sound horizon angle 100*theta_s = 1.040786
 -> baryon drag stops at z = 1059.833883
    corresponding to conformal time = 286.646779 Mpc
    with comoving sound horizon rs = 147.331459 Mpc
