Super-quick README file. The code is super preliminary, so there's a lot
of documentation that needs to be put in place, besides all the extra work
that is missing (see TODO). I'm only giving a rough description of where
everything is for the moment, but this will improve.

Files:
 - classt_mod_dir contains the most recent modified version of CLASS.
 - common.py contains the routines used to read and parse the param file,
   compute power-spectra and Fisher matrix.
 - fisher_plot.py contains routines to print the ellipses
 - in_out.py contains routines to create the CLASS param files based on
   user input.
 - noise.py contains functions to compute the noise power spectrum of
   the different tracers.
 - tracers.py contains the functions used to initialize each tracer and
   compute all tracer-specific quantities (e.g. window functions, number
   densities, noises).

Installation:
  - Go into classt_mod_dir and compile class_mod (our modified version of CLASS)
  - Move the executable (class_mod) into the base directory (this one).

Run:
  - Edit 'param_sample.ini' at will
  - type 'python main.py'

ATTENTION: If the code finds Cl's in the output directory, it won't run CLASS. 
This means that any modifications in the fiducial cosmology that you might have
made since the last run will not be taken into account. Make sure to remove
all output files before making a new run.
